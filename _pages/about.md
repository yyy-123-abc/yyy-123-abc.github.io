I am a master's student from [Xi'an University of Electronic Science and Technology](https://www.xidian.edu.cn/). My research interests include computer vision, machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence algorithms.

I am very fortunate to be studying at the [School of Artificial Intelligence, Xi'an University of Electronic Science and Technology](https://www.xidian.edu.cn/), and I look forward to communicating and collaborating with everyone as we strive together.
